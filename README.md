## What is Churn Prediction Model?
Churn Prediction Model is a predictive model that calculates, on an individual customer basis, the likelihood (or susceptibility) that a customer will stop doing business with the company. It gives you an indication, for each customer at any given time, of how high the risk is that you will lose them in the future.

Itâ€™s a binary classifier, which means that it divides customers into two distinct groups (classes) based on whether or not they leave the company. In most cases, in addition to placing them in one of the two groups, it will also tell you the likelihood that the customer is a member of that group.

In this repository, we have performed the end to end Exploratory Data Analysis, and idenfitied the characteristics of the customers that are more likely to churn, and I have used them wisely to create a model, and lately, have deployed the model.

The predicton model was trained on the dataset, all the data are based on claims similar to real world. The accuracy rate of the model prediction is 75% with xgboost and using hyperparameters.
